My name is Leonardo Maglanoc, and I'm a robotics & AI master student at the Technical University Munich. I'm currently working on physical human-robot interaction as a student research assistant for the [robotics chair](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/home/). If you're interested reading more about my work, I refer to this post. 

Besides studying and researching, I regularly train at the gym. Currently, I'm focusing on calisthenics and bodybuilding. I try to learn new calisthenics techniques and do normal strength training.
