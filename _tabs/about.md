My name is Leonardo Maglanoc, and I'm a robotics & AI master student at the Technical University Munich. I'm currently working on physical human-robot interaction as a [student research assistant]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-jakob_cps %}) for the TUM robotics chair. My long-term research dream is to enable [humanoid robots]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-humanoid_robots %}), who can collaborate with humans and take over repetitive and/or dangerous tasks.

Besides studying and researching, I regularly train at the gym. Currently, I'm focusing on calisthenics and bodybuilding. I learn new calisthenics techniques and do strength training with an emphasis on bodyweight compound movements. Depending on how much free time I have, I also follow nutrition plans to further reach my bodybuilding goals.
