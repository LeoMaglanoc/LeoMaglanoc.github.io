As part of the [Siemens Mentoring Programme](https://ecosystem.siemens.com/researchandinnovation/mentoringprogram/overview), I was invited to the [Siemens RIE Munich Conference](https://ecosystem.siemens.com/researchandinnovation/siemens-rie-munich-conference-2024/overview) to pitch our hackathon project "Smart 3D Printing with Machine Learning" with my co-presenter Jo. 

You have to be very skeptical when people sell you AI & ML solutions, because AI is not the end-all-be-all for all problems. But in my scientific opinion, (physics-based) simulations & digital twins are the perfect application where AI & ML technologies have to be leveraged to accelerate progress! My goal with the pitch was to convey to the audience how much time can be saved by using ML models in comparison to classical simulation models, and how we achieved this for 3D Printing in our project. We almost got the first place, but missed it by only a few votes.
