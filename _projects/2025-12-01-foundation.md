My thesis is a collaboration between [Prof. Cristina Piazza's group](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/nhcr/members/cpiazza/) at TUM MIRMI and Prof. Patrick van der Smagt's group at [Foundation](https://foundation.bot/).

The goal of our method is to grasp an object in a tool-appropriate way, tailored to the object’s intended function. For example, a human grasps a tea mug by the handle to be able to drink from it. With the task-oriented reasoning of an LLM, a generative model determines the multifingered hand configuration of the functional grasp, and a classical motion planner executes the target grasp.
