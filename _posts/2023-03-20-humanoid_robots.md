My long term research dream is to enable humanoid robots, who can collaborate with humans and help us out where needed. Robotics engineers need to be more inspired by biological systems, and more specifically by humans. Virtually all problems roboticists tackle, humans can already achieve very well.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

ideal form and inspiration from humans!

- from a philosophical standpoint: humans are most interested in understanding themselves
- from an application standpoint: many useful scenarios where humanoid form is helpful
- from a research standpoint: many interesting problems to solve

## Neglected type of intelligences

- emotional intelligence
- motor control intelligence

## What Problems need to be solved?

Perception - Planning - Control

TODO: reference interesting work e.g tum ai biped walking, geometric control with dextrous manipulation, Luis pHRI work, Boston Dynamics
