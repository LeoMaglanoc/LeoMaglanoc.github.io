As a robotics enthusiast, my long term research dream is to enable humanoid robots that can collaborate with humans and assist us where needed.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

One of the reasons why I find humanoid robots fascinating is from a philosophical standpoint: humans are most interested in understanding themselves. Therefore, designing robots based on the human form can help us understand ourselves better.

From an application standpoint, humanoid robots can be helpful in many scenarios such as assisting the elderly or disabled, performing tasks in hazardous environments, or even serving as companions for those in need of social interaction.

Moreover, studying humanoid robots provides a rich research space with many interesting problems to solve. For example, one of the most neglected types of intelligence in robotics is emotional intelligence, and humanoid robots could help us explore this field. Another area of research is motor control intelligence, which would allow robots to move more like humans.

## Inspiration for Problems

However, to achieve these goals, robotics engineers need to be more inspired by biological systems, and more specifically by humans. Virtually all problems roboticists tackle, humans can already achieve very well. Therefore, robotics research should aim to replicate the abilities of humans to enable robots to interact with the world as we do.

To achieve this goal, some of the major problems that need to be solved include perception, planning, and control. By improving these areas, we can enable robots to interact with humans in a more intuitive and natural way.
