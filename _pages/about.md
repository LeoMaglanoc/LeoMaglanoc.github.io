I’m Leo, a Robotics & AI research engineer focused on safe humanoid systems. I’m completing my master’s at the Technical University of Munich and writing my [thesis]({{ '/projects/foundation/' | relative_url }}) with Foundation, a Silicon Valley-based humanoid startup, where I develop language-guided multi-finger manipulation using foundation models.


My [mission]({{ '/mission' | relative_url }}) is to make humanoid autonomy deployable in human environments through formal safety guarantees. Long-term, I’m building toward a European physical AI safety company developing certifiable safety infrastructure.

Previously, I worked as an AI/ML research intern at BMW and completed the Siemens mentoring programme. My research experience includes safe human-robot collaboration ([IEEE T-RO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10180), [demo](https://youtu.be/IUAeZGau28E?si=0zWlQfw3i6It8nDD)), neuromorphic computing for tactile sensing, and spatial perception (SLAM) for autonomous drone navigation. I build physical AI systems using Python, PyTorch, and C++.
