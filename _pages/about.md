Hi 👋, I'm Leo, a Robotics & AI master's student at the Technical University of Munich. I'm currently writing my [thesis]({{ '/projects/foundation/' | relative_url }}) in collaboration with Foundation, a humanoid robotics startup, where I'm advancing language-guided multifingered manipulation with foundation models. My [research goal]({{ '/blog/research-goals/' | relative_url }}) is to enable safe and reliable humanoid autonomy in human environments.

Previously, I worked as an AI/ML research intern at BMW and completed the Siemens mentoring programme. I've contributed to several academic research projects, covering fields such as safe human-robot collaboration [(IEEE T-RO)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=bSMJcYMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=bSMJcYMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), neuromorphic computing for tactile sensing, and spatial perception for navigation (SLAM). I’m experienced in C++, Python, and PyTorch for developing AI-driven robotics and machine learning applications.

I have an international background: of Asian heritage, born in Norway, and raised in Germany. Outside of work, I enjoy practicing calisthenics and jogging, reading philosophy, and writing poetry.
