I've been experimenting with Codex, OpenAI's coding agent (Codex 5.2). Below are some games I 'vibecoded' in less than an hour without writing a single code line and having any previous experience with game programming. I additionally used ChatGPT to brainstorm on the design and the mechanics of the game. These games may not be 100% functional, but I'm amazed by the progress and capabilities of generative, agentic AI, even though they have some limitations too.
