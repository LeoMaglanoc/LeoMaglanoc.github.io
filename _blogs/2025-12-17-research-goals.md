My ultimate dream is to enable safe and reliable humanoid autonomy in human environments. I want to achieve this by tackling the following subproblems:

- Safety and reliability guarantees with safe control methods
- Unify manipulation and locomotion in one safe loco-manipulation framework
- Semantic reasoning with foundation models
- Testing safe humanoids in real-world industrial and domestic use cases.

In parallel, I'm interested in deeper theoretical questions that may inform long-term humanoid intelligence:

- Algorithmic foundations of AI agents with neuroscience insights, e.g., continual learning with scalable brain-inspired architectures
- Mathematical theory of AI 

Overall, my research spans the full technology pipeline of intelligent humanoid systems:
