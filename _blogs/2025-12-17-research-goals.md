My ultimate dream is to enable safe and reliable humanoid autonomy in human environments. I want to achieve this by tackling the following subproblems:

- Safety and reliability guarantees with safe control methods
- Unify manipulation and locomotion in one safe loco-manipulation framework
- Semantic reasoning with foundation models
- Testing safe humanoids in real-world industrial and domestic use cases.


My first goal is to provide reliability guarantees, for example, through the formal verification of the safety and functionality of robotics systems. Ensuring safe robot autonomy in human environments is a critical issue, as failures such as collisions with humans would be catastrophic and must be prevented if we want to deploy robots in these environments.

My second goal is to extend the problem setting from humanoid manipulation to loco-manipulation. Why? Because most real tasks require mobility of the autonomous system. And because locomotion and manipulation are inherently a coupled problem, if you want to control the whole body of a humanoid.

My third goal is to equip humanoids with semantic reasoning through foundation models. Frontier tech labs have been rapidly advancing the capabilities of large pre-trained models. I aim to design safe methods that are easily compatible with state-of-the-art models.

My fourth goal is to test the deployment of safe humanoids in real use cases outside of lab environments. As part of the vibrant Munich robotics & AI ecosystem, I'd like to foster regular interactions with other engineers and to advance collaborations between academia and industry.

If you are interested in collaborating on any of these topics, please don't hesitate to contact me via email or LinkedIn!
