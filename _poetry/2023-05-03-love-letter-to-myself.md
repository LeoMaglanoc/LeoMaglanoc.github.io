A long letter to my younger self:

You must stop being so harsh to yourself. Stop being so envious of other people. Stop finding things you want to hate about yourself. Start loving yourself unconditionally and focus on being *your* best possible version, regardless of what others do.

Life can be so beautiful if you embrace your true authentic self. You don't understand how much you can achieve if you start believing in yourself. You don't understand that you can reach even the most unimaginable goals if you are ready to invest the necessary time and effort. It's going to be a challenging journey, but you gotta take the initiative, you gotta get out of your comfort zone, you gotta try out new things, you gotta fail, struggle and make mistakes because that's what it takes to become better and stronger. You can't expect to win without having mastered the art of losing. You can't expect to get good without being utterly shit first. And you can't expect to get nice things in life without working for it.

There will be long and hard phases where you put in so much work, but it feels like nothing is progressing or, even worse, things seem to be falling apart. But these are the crucial moments when you can't give up, when you have to keep fighting and keep moving on, despite all the resistance. Because in the end, it's going to be worth it, because of overcoming all the hurdles set in your way when reaching a goal.

Though, you must realize that it's not about reaching your goals. But that the *journey* itself is the goal. Because no matter how good you are, you can always get better! There will always be things to improve and new skills to aquire. Embodying a growth mindset is the greatest gift you can give yourself besides unconditionally loving yourself, of course.

So here's to saying yes to doing things not because society or others expect it of you but to only doing things because *you* want to do them, and to becoming the *main character* of the story of your life.
