In man's pursuit of dreams and distant heights,<br>
he must climb over mountains.<br>
They seem so far, so out of reach.<br>
And man cries: I want to be there now!<br>
But wisdom whispers, not yet.<br>
<br> 
So he treads step by step, and year by year.<br>
The path is dangerous. No soul should walk alone.<br>
So find companions who travel along.<br>
<br>
You rise, you stumble,<br> 
you fall, and you begin again.<br>
And one quiet morning, without knowing when,<br>
man stands on top of the mountain.<br>
<br>
So the cycle of life begins anew.<br>
You search for the next mountain.<br>
And make your way onto the next journey.<br>
