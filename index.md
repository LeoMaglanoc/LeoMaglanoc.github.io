# About Me

My name is Leonardo Maglanoc. I was born in Norway and grew up in Germany. I'm a robotics & AI master's student at the Technical University Munich. Currently, I'm working as a [robotics research assistant]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-jakob_cps %}) for the TUM Cyber-Physical Systems Group on making physical human-robot interaction provably safe with formal verification. My long term research dream is to enable [humanoid robots]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-humanoid_robots %}), who can collaborate with humans and help us out where needed.

Besides studying and researching, I regularly train at the gym. My focus is on calisthenics and bodybuilding. I learn new calisthenics techniques and do hypertrophy training with an emphasis on bodyweight compound movements. Depending on how much free time I have, I also follow nutrition plans to further reach my bodybuilding goals. Some other hobbies of mine are playing the piano, reading non-fiction books and most important of all, spending time with family and friends.
