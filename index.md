# About Me

My name is Leonardo Maglanoc. I'm a 2nd-year robotics & AI master's student at the Technical University Munich, I've worked there as a [robotics research assistant]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-jakob_cps %}) for the Cyber-Physical Systems Group for over a year on making physical human-robot interaction provably safe with formal verification, and I'm a mentee of the [Siemens Mentoring Programme]({% post_url _posts/2024-06-22-siemens %}). I have an international background: Asian heritage, born in Norway and raised in Germany. For my studies, I'm focusing on Mobile Robotics and 3D Computer Vision, such as in one practical of the Smart Robotics Lab, where we programmed an [autonomous drone]({% post_url _posts/2024-03-13-rmil_practical %}). My goal is to build autonomous machine intelligence, taking humans as an inspiration, and enabling robots to sense, plan, and act cognitively in our physical world. I'm particularly fascinated by [humanoid robots]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-humanoid_robots %}).

In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, do sports (calisthenics and bodybuilding),
and read books about philosophy and self-improvement.

- 18.09.24: started Erasmus exchange semester at KU Leuven, Belgium. Taking courses from the Advanced Master's AI programme like Neural Computing and Natural Language Processing. 
- 03.06.24: participated in Siemens Hackathon and Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystem Conference. Presented our project on [Smart 3D Printing with Machine Learning]({% post_url _posts/2024-06-22-siemens %}). We almost got the first place, but missed it by only a few votes.
- 17.05.24: sponsored as a guest to visit the [Upper Bound AI conference](https://www.upperbound.ai/) in Edmonton, Canada. Listened to many talks on current and future Reinforcement Learning research (e.g. from Richard Sutton).
- 15.04.24: started my guided research project at the [Smart Robotics Lab](https://srl.cit.tum.de/) in 3D Computer Vision with the title: "Geometry and Intensity Feature Detection for LiDAR SLAM with Dense Volumetric Mapping".
