# About Me

My name is Leonardo Maglanoc. I currently work at the [BMW AI group of Robotac](https://www.robotac.eu/team) as an AI/ML research engineer. I'm finishing my robotics & AI master's at the Technical University Munich, I've worked there as a [robotics research assistant]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-jakob_cps %}) for the Cyber-Physical Systems Group for over a year, and I was a mentee of the [Siemens Mentoring Programme]({% post_url _posts/2024-06-22-siemens %}). I have an international background: Asian heritage, born in Norway and raised in Germany. My goal is to build autonomous machine intelligence, taking humans as an inspiration, and enabling robots to sense, plan, and act cognitively in our physical world. I'm particularly fascinated by [humanoid robots]({% post_url _posts/2023-03-20-humanoid_robots %}).

In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, do sports (calisthenics and bodybuilding),
and read books about philosophy and self-improvement.
